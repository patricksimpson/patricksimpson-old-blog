{"title":"Midyear Ramblings","date":"26 Jun 14 @ 06:50","body":"<h2 id=\"back-to-writing\">Back to Writing</h2>\n<p>Staring at a blank screen again. The past few months have flown by and I have yet to write anything significant. Though I believe I was just not born to be a writer, discussions at work have seemed to coerce me back to writing. So here I am again staring at a blank screen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ideas\">Ideas</h2>\n<p>I feel swamped with information on a daily basis. I tend to want to read about things that are particularly interesting to me. During the course of a day I will be flooded with links, information, and ideas from other folks. The biggest problem I face is making these ideas (links &amp; information) relevant. I usually follow the following thought process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this relevant to what I am doing now?</li>\n<li>Is this something relevant to my job in general?</li>\n<li>Is this something I am interested in (hobby, etc)?</li>\n<li>Is this something I may have an interest in (job related, or hobby, etc)?</li>\n<li>Is this something I will find entertaining?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The truth is, when it fails these internal questions, I generally ignore it. I may miss something important or noteworthy, miss an opportunity to pick up something new. Maybe I am being selfish?</p>\n<p>Instead of asking these questions centered around “me” (self centered) I will ask this question: “What is the motivation behind this?”. Someone took the time to share this with me and others. That is <em>something</em>. Instead of ignoring it (if it will take longer than 2 minutes) add it to my list of “read later” and sometime in the future and read it.</p>\n<p>How about you? How do you handle the information overload?</p>\n"}
