{"title":"Gulp + Harp + BrowserSync = <3","date":"1-Nov-2014","order":4,"synopsis":"To blog like a hacker, is to blog like a slacker","body":"<!---\n-->\n\n<p>After a week of toiling with this little experiment. Here we have it. My blog engine!</p>\n<p>This was a test post, but it is a real post indeed.</p>\n<p>Here is why.</p>\n<p>This is written in my posts directory, using my Gulp tasks to integrate into HarpJS.\nI needed something to show up, so I created this post and started typing. Yep. That’s it.</p>\n<p>So it’s not complete, but it’s progress. I love it. I love writting in my editor of choice. These words that I write\nare completely free of me feeling “out of my zone”.</p>\n<p>I will be posting a longer form post when I am readying to launch. I will also be posting a follow up code/breakdown posts when I get that rolling that is.\nAlso I will be migrating my old posts from my Ghost blog into my new engine. So if you want to read random tid-bits about me and/or code. Then yay you’ll be able to read them soon.\nFor now, enjoy. Thanks for reading!</p>\n"}
