{"title":"My Static Markdown Blog Engine","date":"November 3, 2014 @ 10:12","synopsis":"The a-typical hello world post.","body":"<p>So I started out on this journey, building a blog that I actually enjoy using. Yep, I know it has been done.\nBut this idea has been bugging me for a long time. With other blogs, I <em>always</em> felt like I just give up a little control.</p>\n<p>Ghost was my hope. I loved, no LOVED Ghost’s backend interface. It’s barrier to entry was what won me over.\nThe problem was I felt like I lost control over my content. Yes, I was allowed to quickly create and edit posts, but I felt like modifying it outside\nof what Ghost was providing was difficult or out of reach sort-of-speak. Not to mention (until very recently), you’d lose your post if the browser\ncrashed and you forgot to “save a draft”.</p>\n<p>So I stumbled upon Harp.js about 2 weeks ago. I was amazed at how simple and easy they wrapped up features that I wanted. Not to mention, one command to create the static version of it all.\n This is basically what i’ve wanted all along. Something simple and a joy to use.</p>\n<p>Where it failed was, <em>not</em> enough features: such as browsersync (live reload) and creating a static blog proved to be a lot of maintence. (More than I wanted to do). \nThat’s where Ghost won, and I didn’t want give up on that dream. Barrier to entry was one of my biggest concerns afterall.</p>\n<p>So Gulp. Yep that’s right, I’ve created a Gulp wrapper (including browsersync) to my HarpJS blog. Now it allows me to create blog posts with insane speeds, and still have my static\nsite that I always wanted. Not to mention, I feel like I have 100% control over everything. Content, markup, markdown, etc..</p>\n<h2 id=\"too-much-\">Too much?</h2>\n<p>Did I do too much? I really don’t think I did. Yep I spent a couple of weekends and nights working on this gulp wrapper to be perfect. I wanted it to be easy to use for me as well as for anyone else.\nIf that’s too much, well whatever. I feel like I learned, I gained, and I am enjoying my new static blog engine. Gulp + Browser Sync + HarpJS = &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>\nThis is what works for me.\nI don’t hate Ghost, and I do recommend it to those looking to blog. It was great. It just wasn’t for me.</p>\n"}
