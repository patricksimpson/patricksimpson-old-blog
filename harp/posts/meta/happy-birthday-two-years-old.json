{"title":"Happy Birthday - Two Years Old!","date":"19 Sep 14 @ 08:30","body":"<p>Today, my little girl turns two.</p>\n<p>Two years ago this day, my wife and I started a journey that would change our family.</p>\n<p>It would bring us closer together, in faith and in love.</p>\n<p>Samantha was born <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20031294\">without the left side of her heart</a>. We would spend, eight weeks in the hospital, most of which spent in the Cardic ICU (CICU) at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital.</p>\n<p>{<1>}<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Sep/samantha.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha After Surgery\"></p>\n<p>Abbey and I spent six of those weeks staying at the <a href=\"http://www.rmhcincinnati.org/\">Cincinnati Ronald McDonald House</a>, which I will be forever grateful for. (<a href=\"https://www.rmhcincinnati.org/help/donate/donate-online\">Donate if you can</a>.)</p>\n<p>After all of that uncertainty, the emotional roller coaster we rode nearly everyday in the hospital — we are <em>here</em> two years later, healthy and strong. She still uses a G-Tube for food and is on exactly one medicine. She has made it. We love our baby. Our two year old angel.</p>\n<p>{<2>}<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Sep/angel.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Today\"></p>\n<p>Don’t give up, don’t give in. Have faith, it will get better.</p>\n<p>God bless.</p>\n"}
