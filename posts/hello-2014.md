Yes, I know it has been a while since I last wrote anything on my own blog. It took me a long time to get it all sorted out. Anyway, here are some of my goals for the year. 

### Family 
My family is one of my greatest blessings. My oldest is now 6 years old (going on 7). I see old photos of my family and wonder where has that time gone? So this year, spending more quality time with my family is first. 

### More reading

Reading. This article sums it up [why you and I should be reading](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/12/health-benefits-reading_n_4081258.html). 

Perhaps my favorite reasons:

#### Relieves stress
Yes, it does. When I read, it can calm me down from a very stressful day. 

#### Increases general knowledge
No input, no output. What you feed your mind produces a result, no question about that.


### More writing

Writing helps me in so many ways. It challenges me. It motivates me to do more. It allows me to grow, by researching and readingn topics I might not have otherwise. 

#### It forces me to read
Yep, when I write, I read.
