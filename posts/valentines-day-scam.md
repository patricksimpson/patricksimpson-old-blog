Why does Valentines day just seems like a big scam to me? 

Picking one day out of the year to say "I love you" to your speical someone, just seems overrated.

What about the rest of the year? Not saying that you shouldn't say "I love you" today or do something special, but try doing it more than once per year why don't we?

Valentines day, like "sweetest day", just seem like Ester price/Hallmark conspiracies. Invented to make dollars.

So, that's my two cents... For the record, I did get my wife a gift, but I gave it to her early, just couldn't wait until some random day to give it to her.

**I love you Abbey, happy Valentines Day!**
