After a week of toiling with this little experiment. Here we have it. My blog engine!

This was a test post, but it is a real post indeed.

Here is why.

This is written in my posts directory, using my Gulp tasks to integrate into HarpJS.
I needed something to show up, so I created this post and started typing. Yep. That's it.

So it's not complete, but it's progress. I love it. I love writting in my editor of choice. These words that I write
are completely free of me feeling "out of my zone".

I will be posting a longer form post when I am readying to launch. I will also be posting a follow up code/breakdown posts when I get that rolling that is.
Also I will be migrating my old posts from my Ghost blog into my new engine. So if you want to read random tid-bits about me and/or code. Then yay you'll be able to read them soon.
For now, enjoy. Thanks for reading!
