[Letting Go](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6092829/letting%20go%20of%20the%20past.png)

I have a hoarding problem. Not a materialistic hoarding problem. I have a hoarding problem in my mind, and it's time to let go. Let go of all those ideas and/or dreams that are cluttering up my mind. 

So, you may be thinking "Why would you want to let go of your ideas and dreams?" "Isn't that what drives you?" "Isn't it good to have these on your mind?"

It is, when it is time. I am not saying "throw them away", just get them out of your mind, let go of them (for now).

Last year, it dawned on me how important of a concept this is, for someone like me. I have a tendancy to hang on to things (in my head) for a long time. While I am able to remove phyiscal things from my life, in my mind I have a hoarding problem.

Hoarding? 

I thought this through a little bit more: 
Hoarding is as much as a physical problem for some, as a mental problem for others. In other words, clutter in our minds is just as a problem as clutter in our phyiscal space. If you're not getting things done like you want to, you may need to declutter your mind as you would your physical space.

How do you do this?

1. Follow the Getting Things Done ([GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)) method!

2. Write down everything in your mind. Yes, write everything down and file it away. ( I use [omni focus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/), but that's me. Find what works for you.)

3. Once it's written down, stop thinking about it. Let it go. It's just taking up space in your head. 

4. Once it is out of your head, don't think about it again. Your cluttlered mind will nag you if it's there. Which is what is keeping you from getting the thing done that's right in front of you. 

5. Do the most important thing on your list. When complete, do the next thing.

6. Relax, this stuff takes time. This is hard for me, but you should give yourself time to decompress. Otherwise you'll go crazy.

I admit this is a difficult process, and it takes getting used to and time. I am working on it, but there's a lot of clutter up there afterall, it's going to take time. Don't let something clutter up your mind. Start letting go.
