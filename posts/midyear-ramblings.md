##Back to Writing

Staring at a blank screen again. The past few months have flown by and I have yet to write anything significant. Though I believe I was just not born to be a writer, discussions at work have seemed to coerce me back to writing. So here I am again staring at a blank screen.


##Ideas

I feel swamped with information on a daily basis. I tend to want to read about things that are particularly interesting to me. During the course of a day I will be flooded with links, information, and ideas from other folks. The biggest problem I face is making these ideas (links & information) relevant. I usually follow the following thought process:

- Is this relevant to what I am doing now?
- Is this something relevant to my job in general?
- Is this something I am interested in (hobby, etc)?
- Is this something I may have an interest in (job related, or hobby, etc)?
- Is this something I will find entertaining?

The truth is, when it fails these internal questions, I generally ignore it. I may miss something important or noteworthy, miss an opportunity to pick up something new. Maybe I am being selfish?

Instead of asking these questions centered around “me” (self centered) I will ask this question: “What is the motivation behind this?”. Someone took the time to share this with me and others. That is *something*. Instead of ignoring it (if it will take longer than 2 minutes) add it to my list of "read later" and sometime in the future and read it.

How about you? How do you handle the information overload?
