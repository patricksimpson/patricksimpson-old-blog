Well, we did it! Our house is on the market. We have listed it on [zillow.com](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/309-N-Grant-St-Christiansburg-OH-45389/75051717_zpid/) [craigslist](http://dayton.craigslist.org/reo/4603513893.html), and [realtor.com](http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/309-N-Grant_Christiansburg_OH_45389_M32794-87297?row=1).

I also setup my very own domain and website to help with the details of the home: http://www.onehomeforsale.com/

Now we wait.
