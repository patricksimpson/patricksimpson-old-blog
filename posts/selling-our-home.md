### The Process
There are many, many things one has to do to prepare to sell their home. This is so very true, and I am living this reality as of right now. My wife and I have decided to begin the process of selling our home and see where this journey will take us. We have not yet decided fully decided where to move to, that is excitement yet to come.

The process of "preparing" to move is really just my "honey-do" list that I have had for quite some time. Which I would accomplish one or two things a month...Instead, I am cramming all of these "todos" into a weekend, so far it feels like it's paying off. A strong feeling of relief comes over me when I realize all the things I have done _are done_. 

### FSBO

The decision to sell my home myself, really comes from my own self motivation and drive to get things done. Not that I don't think a relator could do this, in fact I am sure they could and would. I just feel that I am more than capable of doing the job. I am also very interested in how the process works, from the ground up. The best way to learn is to do.

Also, it's fair to mention commission rates via an agent would make it difficult to price the home competitively. I am not sure how else to put it. We'll see how this goes of course, for now, it's my story. 

### Our Home

Really, I do enjoy our home and we have made it a great one. It will be sad to leave it behind. However, we are excited and eager to take on new challenges. We have lived here since 2007, rented for a year and then purchased the house the following year. 

It has truly been a blessing to us. All three of our little ones have never known another home. WE made it a home though, as the saying goes "the home is where the heart is". This really rings true. I know it can and, Lord willing, serve another family the same way it served us.

If you are interested in purchasing a little slice of Christiansburg, Ohio, be sure to let me know. I will post a follow up link to my little website showcasing the house. Followed by the listing information, etc.
