Winter starts to fade away... spring is in the air. I love that spring gives me a renewed sense of purpose.  It drives away the cold, dead and replaces it with new life and warmth. 

Seems like yesterday the cold and dreary days of winter were in full swing. We hit -18 degrees fahrenheit this time around. Brr... I am glad that's over with. 

### Ember Everything

During the winter I learned [Ember](http://emberjs.com/). I used it to work on a personal project of mine that I had been putting off for a long time: [thetable.io](http://thetable.io). What an *amazing*  and *enjoyable* experiance! Ember is an amazing JavaScript framework, it allows you to create applications in the fraction of the time it used to. I am exicted about the future of Ember and JavaScript. 

I went to [Ember Conf](http://emberconf.com/) and met the amazing Ember community. What a bunch! Loved it.  My co-worker, friend, Jeremy Mack released an app called "Find" [fnd.io](https://fnd.io/). Which is an amazing Ember application that allows you to search the app store in blazing fast speed.

Now all I can think about is Ember. I cannot wait to start my next Ember project. 

I will continue to develop in other languages, but now that I know the brighter side of Ember, I will advocate it. I encourage you to check it out, learn it, live it.
